<h6>Remember <br>
the sky that you were born under,
know each of the star's stories.<br>
Remember the moon, know who she is. <br>
Remember the sun's birth at dawn, that is the <br>
strongest point of time.
<br>
Remember sundown <br>
and the giving away to night. </h6>
<h5>Remember <br>
your birth, how your mother struggled <br>
to give you form and breath.<br>
You are evidence of <br>
her life, and her mother's, and hers.<br>
Remember your father. He is your life, also. </h5>
<h4>Remember <br>
the earth whose skin you are: <br>
red earth, black earth, yellow earth, white earth <br>
brown earth, we are earth.<br>
Remember the plants, trees, animal life who all have their <br>
tribes, their families, their histories, too. Talk to them, <br>
listen to them. They are alive poems.<br>
Remember the wind. Remember her voice. She knows the <br>
origin of this universe. </h4>
<h3>Remember <br>
you are all people and all people 
are you.<br>
Remember you are this universe and this 
universe is you.<br>
Remember all is in motion, is growing, is you.<br>
Remember language comes from this.<br>
Remember the dance language is, that life is.<br> </h3>
