Remember
<br> 
the sky that you were born under,
know each of the star's stories.
<br>
Remember
<br>
the moon, know who she is.
<br>
Remember
<br>
the sun's birth at dawn, that is the
strongest point of time.
<br>
Remember
<br>
sundown and the giving away to night.
<br>
Remember
<br>
your birth, how your mother struggled
to give you form and breath. You are evidence of
her life, and her mother's, and hers.
<br>
Remember
<br>
your father. He is your life, also.
<br>
Remember
<br>
 the earth whose skin you are:
red earth, black earth, yellow earth, white earth
brown earth, we are earth.
<br>
Remember
<br>
 the plants, trees, animal life who all have their
tribes, their families, their histories, too. Talk to them,
listen to them. They are alive poems.
<br>
Remember the wind. Remember her voice. She knows the
origin of this universe.
<br>
Remember 
<br>
you are all people and all people
are you.
<br>
Remember
<br> you are this universe and this
universe is you.
<br>
Remember
<br>
 all is in motion, is growing, is you.
<br>
Remember
<br>
 language comes from this.
 <br>
Remember
<br> the dance language is, that life is.
<br>
<br>
Remember.
