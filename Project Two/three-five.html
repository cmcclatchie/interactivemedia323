<h1> Remember </h1>
<div id="stanzaone">
<br> 
the sky that you were born under,
know each of the star's stories.

</div>

<div id="stanzatwo">
the moon, know who she is.
</div>


<div id="stanzathree">
the sun's birth at dawn, that is the
strongest point of time.
</div>

<div id="stanzafour">
sundown and the giving away to night.
</div>

<div id="stanzafive">
your birth, how your mother struggled
to give you form and breath. You are evidence of
her life, and her mother's, and hers.
</div>

<div id="stanzasix">
your father. He is your life, also.
</div>

<div id="stanzaseven">
 the earth whose skin you are:
red earth, black earth, yellow earth, white earth
brown earth, we are earth.
</div>

<div id="stanzaeight">
the plants, trees, animal life who all have their
tribes, their families, their histories, too. Talk to them,
listen to them. They are alive poems.
</div>

<div id="stanzanine">
the wind. Remember her voice. She knows the
origin of this universe.
</div>

<div id="stanzaten">
you are all people and all people
are you.
</div>

<div id="stanzaeleven">
you are this universe and this
universe is you.
</div>

<div id="stanzatwelve">
 all is in motion, is growing, is you.
</div>

<div id="stanzathriteen">
 language comes from this.
</div>

<div id="stanzafourteen">
the dance language is, that life is.
</div>
