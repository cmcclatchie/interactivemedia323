<h1> Remember </h1>

<div id="poem">

the sky that you were born under,
know each of the star's stories.  <br>
the moon, know who she is. <br>
the sun's birth at dawn, that is the
strongest point of time. <br>
sundown and the giving away to night.

</div>

<br>
<br>

<div id="stanza2">
your birth, how your mother struggled to give you form and breath. You are evidence of her life, and her mother's, and hers. Remember your father. He is your life, also.</div>

<br>
<br>

<div id="stanza3">
the earth whose skin you are:
red earth, black earth, yellow earth, white earth
brown earth, we are earth.
</div>


<div id="stanza4">
the plants, trees, animal life who all have their
tribes, their families, their histories, too. Talk to them,
listen to them. They are alive poems.
</div>

<br>
<br>

<div id="stanza5">
the wind. <br>
her voice. She knows the
origin of this universe.
</div>

<div id="stanza6">
you are all people and all people
are you.
</div>

<div id="stanza7">
all is in motion, is growing, is you. <br>
language comes from this. <b></b>
the dance language is, that life is.
</div>

<div id="stanza8">
you are this universe and this
universe is you.
</div>

<div id="stanza9">
Remember
