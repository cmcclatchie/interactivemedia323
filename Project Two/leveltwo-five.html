<h1>Remember</h1> 
<em>The sky</em> that you were born under,<br>
<em> Know </em> each of the star's stories.<br>
<strong>Remember</strong> <em> the moon</em>, know who she is. <br>
<strong>Remember</strong> the sun's birth at dawn, <br> That is the
strongest point of time.
<br>
<strong>Remember</strong> <em> sundown </em>
and the giving away to night.
<h1>Remember</h1>
Your birth, how your mother struggled
to give you form and breath.<br>
You are evidence of
her life, and her mother's, and hers.<br>
<strong>Remember</strong> your father. He is your life, also.
<h1>Remember</h1>
the earth whose skin you are:
red earth, black earth, yellow earth, white earth
brown earth, we are earth.<br>
<strong>Remember</strong> the plants, trees, animal life who all have their
tribes, their families, their histories, too. Talk to them,
listen to them. They are alive poems.<br>
<strong>Remember</strong> the wind. <strong>Remember</strong> her voice. She knows the
origin of this universe.
<h1>Remember</h1>
you are all people and all people
are you.<br>
<strong>Remember</strong> you are this universe and this
universe is you.<br>
<strong>Remember</strong> all is in motion, is growing, is you.<br>
<strong>Remember</strong> language comes from this.<br>
<strong>Remember</strong> the dance language is, that life is.<br>
<h1>Remember.</h1>
