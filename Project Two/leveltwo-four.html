<h5>Remember <br>
the sky <br> </h5>  <h6>that you were born under,
know each of the star's stories.<br>
Remember the moon, know who she is. <br>
Remember the sun's birth at dawn, that is the <br>
strongest point of time.</h6>
<h5>Remember sundown <br>
and the giving away to night.</h5>

<h4>Remember <br>
your birth,</h4> <h5> how your mother struggled <br>
to give you form and breath.<br>
You are evidence of <br>
her life, and her mother's, and hers.<br></h5>
<h4>Remember your father. <br> He is your life, also. </h4>

<h3>Remember <br>
the earth </h3> 
<h4> whose skin you are: <br>
red earth, black earth, yellow earth, white earth <br>
brown earth, we are earth.<br> 
Remember the plants, trees, animal life who all have their <br>
tribes, their families, their histories, too. Talk to them, <br>
listen to them. They are alive poems.<br>
Remember the wind. </h4> 
<h3> Remember her voice. She knows the <br>
origin of this universe.  </h3>

<h2>Remember <br>
you are all people </h2> 

<h3> and all people 
are you.<br>
Remember you are this universe and this 
universe is you.<br>
Remember all is in motion, is growing, is you.<br>
Remember language comes from this.<br>
Remember the dance language is, that life is.<br> </h3>
<h1>Remember.</h1>
