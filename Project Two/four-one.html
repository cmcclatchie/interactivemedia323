<h1>Remember</h1> 
the sky that you were born under,
know each of the star's stories.<br>
<h1>Remember</h1> the moon, know who she is.
<h1>Remember</h1> the sun's birth at dawn, that is the
strongest point of time.
<br>
<h1>Remember</h1> sundown
and the giving away to night.
<h1>Remember</h1>
your birth, how your mother struggled
to give you form and breath.<br>
You are evidence of
her life, and her mother's, and hers.<br>
<h1>Remember</h1> your father. He is your life, also.
<h1>Remember</h1>
the earth whose skin you are:
red earth, black earth, yellow earth, white earth
brown earth, we are earth.<br>
<h1>Remember</h1> the plants, trees, animal life who all have their
tribes, their families, their histories, too. Talk to them,
listen to them. They are alive poems.<br>
<h1>Remember</h1> the wind. <h1>Remember</h1> her voice. She knows the
origin of this universe.
<h1>Remember</h1>
you are all people and all people
are you.<br>
<h1>Remember</h1> you are this universe and this
universe is you.<br>
<h1>Remember</h1> all is in motion, is growing, is you.<br>
<h1>Remember</h1> language comes from this.<br>
<h1>Remember</h1> the dance language is, that life is.<br>
<h1>Remember.</h1>
