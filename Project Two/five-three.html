<div id="stanza2">
the sky that you were born under,
know each of the star's stories.  
<br> <br>
<br> <br>
the moon, know who she is. 
<br> <br>
<br> <br>
the sun's birth at dawn, that is the
strongest point of time. 
<br> <br>
<br> <br>
sundown and the giving away to night. 
<br> <br>
<br> <br>
your birth, how your mother struggled to give you form and breath. You are evidence of her life, and her mother's, and hers. 
<br> <br>
<br> <br>
your father. He is your life, also. 
<br> <br>
<br> <br>
the earth whose skin you are:
red earth, black earth, yellow earth, white earth
brown earth, we are earth. 
<br> <br>
<br> <br>
the plants, trees, animal life who all have their
tribes, their families, their histories, too. Talk to them,
listen to them. They are alive poems.
<br> <br>
<br> <br>
the wind. 
<br> <br>
<br> <br>
her voice. She knows the
origin of this universe.
<br> <br>
<br> <br>
you are all people and all people
are you.
<br> <br>
<br> <br>
you are this universe and this
universe is you.
<br> <br>
<br> <br>
all is in motion, is growing, is you.
<br> <br>
<br> <br>
language comes from this.
<br> <br>
<br> <br>
the dance language is, that life is.
