<h1>Remember</h1> 
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the sky that you were born under,
<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp know each of the star's stories.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <strong>Remember</strong> the moon, know who she is.
<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <strong>Remember</strong> the sun's birth at dawn, that is the
strongest point of time.
<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
<strong>Remember</strong> sundown
and the giving away to night.
<h1> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Remember</h1>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp your birth, how your mother struggled
to give you form and breath.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
You are evidence of
her life, and her mother's, and hers.<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
<strong>Remember</strong> your father. He is your life, also.
<h1> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Remember</h1>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the earth whose skin you are:
<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp red earth, black earth, yellow earth, white earth
brown earth, we are earth.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <strong>Remember</strong> the plants, trees, animal life who all have their <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp tribes, their families, their histories, too. Talk to them,<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp listen to them. They are alive poems.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <strong>Remember</strong> the wind. <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <strong>Remember</strong> her voice. She knows the
origin of this universe.
<h1> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Remember</h1>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp you are all people and all people
are you.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <strong>Remember</strong> you are this universe and this
universe is you.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <strong>Remember</strong> all is in motion, is growing, is you.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <strong>Remember</strong> language comes from this.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <strong>Remember</strong> the dance language is, that life is.<br>
